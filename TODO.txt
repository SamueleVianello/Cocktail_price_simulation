currently working on:

-> add a .reset() to Simulation class to reset simulation and all processes

-> ?include unit of account into the Commodity class (and list)?


model info:



# PRICE_PROCESS
-> ?Decrease price only if previous dt also didn't have any order?
-> [tech] move drawing graph inside the class (now it's in the DRAW LOOP)
-> add function to compute PROFIT (given unit cost) --> Added in the Commodity class


# CUSTOMER
---- customer order dynamics ----
-> ?define utility function? 
-> ?set limit over which not buying? (set alert for when price comes down)
-> ?set instant buy when cheap? (add delay between buys)

?INTERACTIVITY between CUSTOMERS and COMMODITY?

SIMULATION
-> Simulation does not properly work: if dt too big, cant simulate enough arrival times
    --> simulate a fixed number of arrival times before hand (related to drinks per hour)?
    --> or just use lots of clients and less drinks per hours ^^^THIS^^^
